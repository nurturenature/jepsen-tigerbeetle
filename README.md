# `jepsen-tigerbeetle`

### A [Jepsen](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) Test for [TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle).

## Why TigerBeetle?

- sound grounding in research
- test culture
- devs are helpful in the chat

## Why Jepsen?

TigerBeetle does [similar testing](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/viewstamped-replication-made-famous) during development, so why try Jepsen?

Jepsen is [good](http://jepsen.io/analyses):

- real running clusters
- real environmental faults
- existing tests and models evolved by finding bugs and increasing understanding time and time again

My personal belief is that Jepsen's the map is not the territory and highly adapted property generators will find a bug. Even in a meaningfully tested system like TigerBeetle. I also think that it will be necessary to enhance the existing bank test to be most fruitful. Let's see what we can learn...

## Developing the Jepsen Test

`jepsen-tigerbeetle`:

- builds
  - [tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle) 
  - [tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle-java](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle-java) (Jepsen is Clojure so uses Java client)
- can install/remove, setup/teardown, and start/stop arbitrary TigerBeetle replicas
- capture stdout/stderr, logs, and data files

----

### Bank Test

Uses Jepsen's [bank test](https://jepsen-io.github.io/jepsen/jepsen.tests.bank.html).

```clj
; sample bank client operations

:invoke	:transfer	{:from 2, :to 1, :amount 3}
:ok	:transfer	{:from 2, :to 1, :amount 3}
:invoke	:transfer	{:from 1, :to 2, :amount 2}
:ok	:transfer	{:from 1, :to 2, :amount 2}
:invoke	:read	nil
:ok	:read	{1 -3, 2 3}
```

Jepsen's bank `checker` insures:
  - all totals match
  - `:negative-balances?` is respected
  - stats and plots 

----
  
### Account Creation/Lookup

Treats TigerBeetle's immutable accounts, their creation, lookup, and ledgers as a grow only set.

Uses Jepsen's [set-full](https://jepsen-io.github.io/jepsen/jepsen.checker.html#var-set-full) checker.

The grow only set generates random operations of:
```clj
; sample set-full client operations

:invoke	:add [ledger account]
:ok	:add [ledger account]
:invoke	:read [ledger nil]
:ok	:read [ledger #{account account' ...}]
```

TigerBeetle [is designed](https://tigerbeetle.com/index.html#home_safety) for [strict serializability](http://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable) so `:linearizable? true` is set for the checker. 

----

## Faults

- Partitioning

- Process kill, pause, and resume

- Packet corruption

- File corruption

----

## Current Status

### We found an intentional limitation of the API while the storage layer is being developed. ðŸ™‚

Opened issue: [Multiple operations, ~10, using the Java client crash the server.](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle-java/issues/9)

PR to demonstrate behavior in integration tests: [Enhance integration tests to do multiple account create/lookups to crash the server.](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle-java/pull/10)

And it was confirmed by the development team.

### So we'll take a pause and check back when development progresses...
